🎯 **Current Focus & Career Path**

After completing a master's in cybersecurity and extensive work in AI red teaming, I'm now fully invested in building the foundations required for **traditional red team operations**.

- **OSCP** -> the gateway to being taken seriously as an ethical hacker.
- **OSCE³** -> the long-term north star for deep technical mastery.
- Daily training across HTB, PG Practice, labs, exploit development, and system internals.

My AI red teaming background is a strength, but my future is in full-spectrum offensive security.
